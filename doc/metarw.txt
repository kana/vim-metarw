==============================================================================
INTRODUCTION					*metarw-introduction*

*metarw* is a Vim plugin to provide a framework to read/write anything via
a file of which name is written in a special notation.  Suppose that you are
editing `src/app.js`, and you want to view the same file in another topic
branch.  It is tedius to switch a branch just for viewing a file.  It would be
useful if the file was viewed by `:new git:topic:src/app.js`, wouldn't it?

It is possible to implement such behavior by hooking |BufReadCmd| and other
events.  But it is a tedious task to do so for each time without mistakings.
With metarw, all you have to do write two functions to describe how to
read/write desired contents.

In addition, metarw also provides content browser like |netrw|.  For example,
you can list contents of `src` directory in another topic branch by opening
`git:topic:src/`.  Though you have to define a function for how to list
contents of this fakepath, you don't have to implement netrw-like browser for
each time.


Requirements:
- Vim 8.0 or later

Optionals:
- |metarw-scheme-script| such as
  - |metarw-git| https://github.com/kana/vim-metarw-git
  - |metarw-esa| https://github.com/kana/vim-metarw-esa

INTERFACE					*metarw-interface*

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
COMMANDS					*metarw-commands*

:Edit[!] [++opt] [+cmd] [{file}]		*:Edit*
:Read [++opt] [{file}]				*:Read*
:Source [{file}]				*:Source*
:[range]Write[!] [{file}]			*:Write*
			Same as |:edit| and other commands, but the completion
			of their arguments is extended to also complete
			fakepathes.

			These wrapper commands are not defined automatically.
			If you want them, you have to call
			|metarw#define_wrapper_commands()|.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
FUNCTIONS					*metarw-functions*

						*metarw#complete()*
metarw#complete({arglead}, {cmdline}, {cursorpos})
			Function for |:command-complete| to complete also
			fakepathes.  Use as follows:
			"-complete=customlist,metarw#complete".

					    *metarw#define_wrapper_commands()*
metarw#define_wrapper_commands({override-p})
			Define wrapper commands (see |metarw-commands|.)
			Override existent commands if {override-p} is true.

					    *metarw#is_preparing_to_edit()*
metarw#is_preparing_to_edit()
			Return true if the current context is preparing to
			|:edit| a fakepath rather than to |:read| it.
			Otherwise, return false.
			
			This is useful if you need special configuration for
			interactive editing which is not necessary for :read.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
KEY MAPPINGS					*metarw-key-mappings*

The following key mappings are available for |metarw-content-browser|.  All of
them are buffer-local and defined in Normal mode:


<Plug>(metarw-open-here)			*<Plug>(metarw-open-here)*
<Plug>(metarw-open-split)			*<Plug>(metarw-open-split)*
<Plug>(metarw-open-vsplit)			*<Plug>(metarw-open-vsplit)*
			Open the item under the cursor in the current window
			or newly created window.  If there is no item under
			the cursor, nothing will be happened.

<Plug>(metarw-go-to-parent)			*<Plug>(metarw-go-to-parent)*
			Open the "parent" item in the current window.  The
			"parent" item is always the first item listed in
			a content browser.

					    *g:metarw_no_default_key_mappings*
The following key mappings will be also available unless
g:metarw_no_default_key_mappings is defined:

{lhs}			{rhs}
--------		-----------------------------
<Return>		<Plug>(metarw-open-here)
<C-m>			<Plug>(metarw-open-here)
o			<Plug>(metarw-open-split)
v			<Plug>(metarw-open-vsplit)
-			<Plug>(metarw-go-to-parent)


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CONTENT BROWSER					*metarw-content-browser*

Similar to the relation of directories and files, some sorts of fakepaths are
containers of other fakepaths.  If such fakepaths are given to |:edit|, |:new|
or other commands, metarw will set up the newly created buffer as a content
browser like |newrw|.

In this content browser, |metarw-key-mappings| are available, and 'filetype'
of a content browser is set to "metarw".  Use this information for your own
customization.

						*metarw-browser-item*
Each item displayed in the content browser is represented as a |Dictionary|.
The following keys are available:

label		(string, required)
	The label of the item which is displayed in the content browser.

fakepath	(string, required)
	The fakepath to open the item by |<Plug>(metarw-open-here)| etc.

The first item should be the "parent" of the current {fakepath}, and it is
used for |<Plug>(metarw-go-to-parent)|.




==============================================================================
SCHEMES						*metarw-schemes*

To create your own scheme, write a Vim script file and put the file under
a directory named "autoload/metarw/" in 'runtimepath'.  Such script is called
as a scheme script.  The name of a scheme script must be "{scheme}.vim", where
{scheme} is the name of the scheme.

Scheme scripts must implement all of the following functions:

						*metarw#{scheme}#complete()*
metarw#{scheme}#complete({arglead}, {cmdline}, {cursorpos})
			Complete the names of fakepaths.  This function is
			like the one which is described at
			|:command-completion-customlist|, but there are the
			following differences:

			- {arglead} is split into "head" part and "tail" part.
			  They must fulfill the following equation:
				{arglead} ==# head_part . tail_part
			- This function must complete candidates which are
			  conteind in a stuff represented by the "head" part.
			- Return value is a list with 3 items.
			  The first item is a list of candidates.
			  The second item is the "head" part.
			  The third item is the "tail" part.
			- Returned candidates will be filtered by callers.  So
			  don't filter in this function.

			For example, when completing file names and {arglead}
			is "foo/b":
			- The "head" part is "foo/".
			- The "tail" part is "b".
			- This function must complete files in the directory
			  "foo/".

metarw#{scheme}#read({fakepath})		*metarw#{scheme}#read()*
			Read the content of {fakepath}.

			This function must return a list with two items.  The
			first item indicates the type of a return value, and
			the second item is an additional information for the
			return value.  The meanings of return values are as
			follows:

			First item	Second item ~
			----------	---------------------------------- ~
						*metarw#{scheme}#read()-error*
			"error"		A string which represents an error
					message.
						*metarw#{scheme}#read()-read*
			"read"		A string which will be given to
					|:read| to read the content of
					{fakepath}.

					Or, a |Funcref| to return a list of
					lines from {fakepath}.
						*metarw#{scheme}#read()-browse*
			"browse"	A list of |metarw-brower-item|s to
					set up |metarw-content-browser|.

			See also |metarw#is_preparing_to_edit()|.

						*metarw#{scheme}#write()*
metarw#{scheme}#write({fakepath}, {line1}, {line2}, {append-p})
			Write or append the content of the current buffer from
			{line1} to {line2} into {fakepath}.  If {append-p} is
			true, does appending instead of writing.

			This function must return a list with one or more
			items like |metarw#{scheme}#read()|, but the meanings
			of return values are as follows:

			First item	Rest items ~
			----------	----------------------------------- ~
					       *metarw#{scheme}#write()-error*
			"error"		The second item must be a string which
					represents an error message.
					       *metarw#{scheme}#write()-write*
			"write"		The second item must be a string which
					will be given to |:write| to write the
					content of {fakepath}, or must be
					a |Funcref| to write to {fakepath}.

					The third item is optional; if it is
					given, it must be a string which is
					a Vim script and it will be
					|:execute|d after writing.
						*metarw#{scheme}#write()-done*
			"done"		The rest items are just ignored.  This
					type means that writing is already
					done by |metarw#{scheme}#write()|.

			Don't reset 'modified' in this function.  It will be
			automatically treated by metarw.




==============================================================================
TERMS						*metarw-terms*

Fakepath					*metarw-fakepath*
	A file-like argument written in a special notation.
	For example, "git:master:src/ui.c" is a fakepath.

Scheme						*metarw-scheme*
	Scheme is the substring before the first ":" in the name of
	a fakepath.  For example, the scheme of "git:master:src/ui.c" is
	"git".

	The name of a scheme must consist of 2 or more characters, and it
	should consist of only lowercase, English alphabets.

Scheme script					*metarw-scheme-script*
	Support script to enable to read/write fakepathes.  One scheme script
	supports just one scheme.




==============================================================================
BUGS						*metarw-bugs*

- {range} for ":read {fakepath}" is ignored and it will always be treated as
  the current line.  Because there is no way to get {range} in |FileReadCmd|.
